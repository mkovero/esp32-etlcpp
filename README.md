# esp32-etlcpp

Wrapper for the [ETLCPP library](https://github.com/ETLCPP/etl) to be used as an ESP-IDF component.

Clone in your project's `component` folder using:

`git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:pablobacho/esp32-etlcpp.git`

I just started working on this. Expect issues. You are welcome to open a pull request with fixes and improvements.
